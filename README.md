# BankruptcyAPP

Project consists of:
  * Client-side - ReactJS
  * Server-side for doing data analysis and Prediction models - Python Flask
  * Server-side for database, to store created prediction model data- .Net (added later when there will be fully working logistic reggresion model on python server-side)
  
Flow of project:
  1. Create api to do bussiness logic with data, logistic reggresion model
  2. Create server side to display results achieved with data
  3. In parallel work on client-side and python server-side until a full automized Logit model is made
  4. Add .Net project (scrap parts of previous project) to store results from python server-side
  5. Add a Self-Organizing Map and Binary Tree models to the api 

ToDo:
 * Add correalation analysis for dataset
 * Display correalation of dataset variables in client-side
 *  update ReadMe file when there will be more free time
 
Issues to fix:
 * Fix errors caused by faulty columns in the method singleLogit
